# MediGuardian

Due to a fast-paced lifestyle, we often forget to take supplements or medication, which can have serious consequences. The fastest-growing group, the elderly, is particularly impacted by this problem. Their memory deteriorates with age, which results in medication non-adherence and a rise in hospital admissions.

Our project Medi-Guardian, an IoT pillbox, attempts to make it easier for elderly people without close caretakers to remember to take their medications on time, cutting the chance of negative medication outcomes by almost six times.
